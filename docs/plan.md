# Boat Telemetry & Control System - Project Plan

**Last Updated:** December 18, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 2-3 Complete ✅ | Phase 4 In Progress

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Build a complete WiFi-based RC boat monitoring and control system with:
- **ESP32** running dual-network firmware with auto-WiFi selection
- **Expo web app** for real-time telemetry monitoring and LED control
- Modular architecture ready for camera integration and data logging

---

## PHASES & STATUS

### ✅ PHASE 1: SENSOR & CAMERA SCOPING - COMPLETE

**Decisions Locked In:**
- **Camera**: ESP32-CAM with OV2640 (ordered, awaiting delivery)
- **Telemetry**: Battery voltage + WiFi RSSI + uptime (essentials covered)
- **Power**: Using 5V from ESC/BEC + 470µF capacitor for stability
- **Budget**: <$100 for all hardware

**Deliverables:**
- Shopping list created
- Component sourcing in progress

---

### ✅ PHASE 2: ESP32 FIRMWARE DEVELOPMENT - COMPLETE

**Status:** Core HTTP API fully functional on home WiFi

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Dual WiFi network support:
  - Primary: Home WiFi `.hidden` (with password)
  - Fallback: iPhone hotspot `Ryan's iPhone 17 Pro`
  - Auto-selection with proper debugging output
- ✅ HTTP endpoints:
  - `GET /status` → returns `{connected, ip_address, uptime_seconds, running_led, flood_led}`
  - `GET /telemetry` → returns `{timestamp, battery_voltage, signal_strength, uptime_seconds, running_mode_state, flood_mode_state, connection_status, ip_address}`
  - `POST /led` → accepts `{mode: "running"|"flood", state: "on"|"off"}`
  - `GET /stream` → placeholder (camera integration pending)
  - `OPTIONS` handlers for CORS support
- ✅ CORS headers on all endpoints (browser compatibility)
- ✅ WiFi reconnection logic (30s retry)
- ✅ Serial output debugging

**Known Limitations:**
- Battery voltage shows `0.0V` (ADC not wired yet)
- LED pins are GPIO 2 and 4 (not 19/22 as originally planned)

**Test Results:**
- Connected on home WiFi: `192.168.1.178`
- All endpoints responding correctly
- LED control working via POST requests
- Telemetry updating reliably

**Location:** `/firmware/boat_telemetry/boat_telemetry.ino`

### ✅ PHASE 3: REACT NATIVE/EXPO APP DEVELOPMENT - COMPLETE

**Status:** Web app running and connected to ESP32

**What's Built:**

1. **Connection Screen**
   - Manual IP entry (pre-filled with `192.168.1.178`)
   - IP persistence in AsyncStorage
   - Connection status indicator (idle/connecting/connected/failed)
   - Error handling with timeouts

2. **Telemetry Screen**
   - 1-second polling from `/telemetry` endpoint
   - Displays: battery voltage, signal strength, uptime, ESP32 status, LED states
   - Error banner for connection issues
   - Navigation to LED Control
   - Responsive 2-column card layout

3. **LED Control Screen**
   - Toggle buttons for Running & Flood LEDs
   - Visual state feedback (colors + indicator dots)
   - POST requests to `/led` endpoint
   - Loading states during toggle

**Architecture:**

```

**Tech Stack:**
- React Native with Expo (web build)
- React Navigation for navigation
- AsyncStorage for IP persistence
- Native `fetch` for HTTP (with timeout wrapper)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Dark maritime theme (navy/white)

**Features:**
- ✅ Cross-origin (CORS) compatible
- ✅ Error handling + timeouts
- ✅ IP memory between sessions
- ✅ Responsive layout
- ✅ Real-time polling

**Running:**
```bash
cd boat-telemetry-app
npm install
npx expo start --web
# Open http://localhost:8081
```

**Location:** `/boat-telemetry-app/`

### ✅ PHASE 4: INTEGRATION & TESTING - COMPLETE

**Completed:**
- ✅ Web app successfully connects to ESP32 on home WiFi
- ✅ Telemetry data displaying correctly
- ✅ LED control responding to user input
- ✅ No crashes during initial testing
- ✅ Connection recovery working
- ✅ ESP32-CAM integrated with live MJPEG stream
- ✅ Camera feed displaying in app dashboard
- ✅ Two-board architecture working (telemetry + camera)
- ✅ Data logging with CSV export implemented
- ✅ Persistent log storage in AsyncStorage

**Architecture:**
- **Telemetry ESP32**: `192.168.1.185` - `/telemetry`, `/led`, `/status`
- **Camera ESP32-CAM**: `192.168.1.187` - `/stream` (MJPEG)
- **App**: Unified dashboard with live camera, telemetry cards, LED toggles

**Sensors Verified:**
- ✅ Water intrusion sensor: GPIO32 (has internal pull-up) - working
- ✅ Battery voltage ADC: GPIO34 with 100kΩ + 47kΩ divider - calibrated & working

**Hardware Status:**
- Telemetry ESP32 fully operational with both sensors
- All telemetry fields displaying correctly in app
- Ready for extended field testing (15+ minutes)

**Next Steps:**
1. Extended 15+ minute stability test
2. Build for iPhone using Expo Go (QR code scan) or EAS Build (TestFlight)

**Xcode Limitation:**
- Mac runs macOS too old for Xcode 16.1+ (required for local iOS builds)
- **Workaround**: Use Expo Go app (scan QR) or EAS Build cloud service
- Web app works perfectly as MVP for current testing

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 15+ minute runtime without crashes
- [ ] All telemetry values accurate
- [ ] LED toggles reliable
- [ ] WiFi reconnection working smoothly
- [ ] Error handling robust

|----------|--------|-----------|
| WiFi Strategy | Home WiFi primary + iPhone fallback | Maximum flexibility for different use cases |
| Web vs Native | Started with web, can build native later | Faster iteration, CORS workaround in place |
| HTTP Client | Native fetch with timeout | No external dependencies, simple & reliable |
| Storage | AsyncStorage | Lightweight, good for simple IP persistence |
| Styling | React Native StyleSheet | Standard, dark maritime theme chosen |
